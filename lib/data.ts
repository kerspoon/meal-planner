This Sunday dinner combines a few of our fibre-fueled favourites: tempeh sausage, rocket-lemon pesto, roasted tomatoes, and cashew cream. It takes longer than some of the other recipes to come together, but the extra effort is worth it.\n\nThe addition of cashew cream is optional, but it makes for an even more luscious dinner. Cashew cream thickens considerably once cooled, so reheat with a few tablespoons of water to thin.\n\nMake the roasted tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 400╦ÜF. Toss the cherry tomatoes with the olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then place on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast for about 25 minutes, until very reduced and soft. Set aside.\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat and add the pasta. Cook until just al dente, reserve 1 cup pasta water, and drain. Set aside.\n\nMake the sausage: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the crumbled tempeh and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the tempeh is browned and crispy. Add the dried fennel, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, sage, minced garlic clove, tamari, maple syrup and lemon juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, for another 2 to 3 minutes and set aside.\n\nMake the pesto: Place the rocket, walnuts, and nutritional yeast in the base of a food processor and blend until very finely chopped. With the motor running, add in the lemon juice, vegetable broth or water, salt, and pepper. Drizzle in the olive oil, if desired. Add more salt and pepper to taste.\n\nTo assemble, toss the cooked spaghetti with the tomatoes, tempeh sausage, pesto, and cashew cream (page 307), if using. Thin with the reserved pasta water, adding 1 tablespoon at a time if needed, until creamy. Serve immediately.\n\nLow FODMAP options:\n5 cherry tomatoes per serving is low in fructans, so if sensitive, then reduce to only 20 cherry tomatoes total, or omit.\nWhole-grain spaghetti is high in fructans. Reduce to ┬¢ cup cooked per serving for FODMAP friendly, or use an alternative pasta option, like quinoa.\nGarlic is high in fructans. Omit and sub 1 teaspoon garlic-infused olive oil (see page 246) for the sausage and 2 teaspoons for the pesto.\nThe cashews in the cashew cream are high in GOS and have moderate fructans. Omit the cashew cream if sensitive.","photos":[]} ,
